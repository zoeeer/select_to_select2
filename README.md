> note: I've disabled select2 on query filter's value selection because there are issues when changing the 'operator'.
> So with this version, you won't have the multiple select effect as in the picture above.

## Installation

1. ```$git clone https://github.com/zoeeer/select_to_select2.git```

2. Copy to ```plugins``` folder under your redmine instance

3. Restart redmine
